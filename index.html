            <h1>New cost-effective scheme empowers type 2 diabetics for better management of glucose levels.</h1>
            <p>Survey shows that a new at-home urine test, &#39;Quick Test&#39; can be an effective tool for managing type 2 diabetes. The survey was produced by Strip Smart, the creators of Quick Test, and was carried out across multiple countries by all types of diabetics over 2 months. 88% of participants said that they would benefit from using their strips to help monitor their condition, with 100% of type 2 diabetics agreeing. <br><br>

                Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by high blood glucose levels, which can cause a range of health complications, including heart disease, stroke, and kidney damage. Managing blood glucose levels is essential for preventing these complications, and Quick Test by Strip Smart can help individuals do so. In addition to this, prediabetes is a serious global issue, however it is preventable through better monitoring and awareness of glucose and ketone levels which can be achieved using these tests. <br><br>
                
                "The easiest test to use and would probably be the most accessible and economical, which may justify its use more widely, especially in LMICs, as a means to monitor prediabetes and prevent progression to diabetes." commented Dr Gabriela Da Silva Xavier, associate professor in cellular metabolism at the University of Birmingham. <br><br>
                
                When sugar levels exceed 180 mg/dl, the blood is overloaded with glucose, leading to its release in the urine. Glucose being released into the urine is a sign of uncontrolled, or pre-diabetes. Quick Tests allow patients to take back control of their sugar levels and prevent ketoacidosis (release of ketones) and dangerous fluctuations in glucose levels. <br><br>
                
                Strip Smart recommends that individuals with type 2 diabetes consider incorporating at-home urine tests into their management plan. However, the researchers caution that urine tests should not be used as the sole method for managing diabetes. Individuals should work closely with their healthcare provider to develop a comprehensive management plan that includes regular monitoring of blood glucose levels. <br><br>
                
                "We hope that our findings will encourage individuals with type 2 diabetes to take an active role in managing their condition," said one of the researchers at Strip Smart. "By regularly monitoring their urine glucose and ketone levels, they can take proactive steps to manage their diabetes and reduce the risk of complications." <br><br>
                
                Strip smart is working in accordance with the 2021 World Health Organisation (WHO) diabetes compact, which aims at improving global management of diabetes. Goals outlined by the WHO included diagnosing 80% of people with diabetes and improving control of glycemia as well as blood pressure for diagnosed patients. <br><br>
                
                Overall, Strip Smart&#39;s new at-home urine test strips are a promising development in the field of diabetes management, especially for type 2 diabetics. They offer a more cost effective, convenient, and non-invasive way of monitoring glucose and ketone levels, helping diabetics make more informed decisions on their health. <br><br>
